# **AI Assistant Command Control: Allow/Deny List & Protections**

When collaborating with an AI assistant in your IDE, especially for tasks that involve code execution or file system modifications, it's crucial to implement granular control over its capabilities. This prevents unintended actions, safeguards your project, and ensures efficient use of computational resources.

This guide explains how to leverage "Command Allowlist," "Command Denylist," and various "Protection" settings, as seen in IDEs like Cursor, to manage your AI assistant effectively for your "Local AI CLI Assistant" project.

## **1\. Understanding Command Allowlist and Denylist**

These features allow you to explicitly define which shell commands or tools your AI assistant is permitted (or forbidden) to execute. This is vital for security, resource management, and maintaining control over your development environment.

### **1.1. Command Allowlist**

**Purpose:** To explicitly list only the commands the AI assistant is **allowed** to run. Any command not on this list will be blocked. This is a "default-deny" security model, offering the highest level of control.

**Why use it?**

* **Security:** Prevents the AI from executing malicious or unintended commands.  
* **Resource Management:** Limits AI to only necessary tools, avoiding the execution of resource-intensive processes.  
* **Predictability:** Ensures the AI operates within defined boundaries for your specific workflow.

**Examples for your "Local AI CLI Assistant" project:**

If your AI assistant is primarily for code generation and simple file operations, you might allow:

* git: For basic version control operations (e.g., git status, git diff).  
* python: To execute Python scripts (e.g., for testing generated code).  
* uv: For package management (uv pip install, uv venv).  
* ruff: For linting and formatting (ruff check, ruff format).  
* ls, cd, pwd, cat: For basic file system navigation and inspection.  
* Your custom my\_ai\_cli command: To test your own CLI tool.

Syntax Example (Conceptual for Cursor, adjust as per actual UI):  
In Cursor's "Command Allowlist" settings, you would typically add entries line by line or as a comma-separated list:  
git  
python  
uv  
ruff  
ls  
cd  
pwd  
cat  
my\_ai\_cli

### **1.2. Command Denylist**

**Purpose:** To explicitly list commands the AI assistant is **forbidden** from running. Any command not on this list is implicitly allowed. This is a "default-allow" model and offers less strict control than an allowlist.

**Why use it?**

* **Quick Prevention:** Immediately block known dangerous or unwanted commands.  
* **Flexibility:** Allows the AI to use most commands by default, only restricting specific ones.

**Examples to Deny for your "Local AI CLI Assistant" project:**

* rm: To prevent accidental file deletion (unless explicitly managed by a protection setting).  
* sudo: To prevent elevated privilege execution.  
* curl, wget: To prevent unauthorized external downloads (unless specifically needed and allowed).  
* npm, docker: If these are not part of your *intended* AI-driven workflow, denying them prevents the AI from trying to use them.  
* Any command that could modify system settings or sensitive configurations.

Syntax Example (Conceptual for Cursor, adjust as per actual UI):  
In Cursor's "Command Denylist" settings:  
rm  
sudo  
curl  
wget  
npm  
docker

## **2\. Protection Settings**

Beyond explicit command lists, IDEs like Cursor offer specific "Protection" toggles to prevent common dangerous actions, adding another layer of safety and control.

* **File Deletion Protection:**  
  * **Purpose:** Prevents the AI agent from deleting files automatically.  
  * **Benefit:** Critical for safeguarding your codebase against accidental or erroneous deletions by the AI.  
  * **Recommendation:** **Always enable this.**  
* **MCP Tools Protection:**  
  * **Purpose:** Prevents the AI agent from running MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools automatically.  
  * **Benefit:** Gives you explicit control over when MCP-related actions (which could involve external interactions or complex workflows) are executed. Since you're integrating MCP, you'll want to carefully manage when the AI can trigger these.  
  * **Recommendation:** Start with this **enabled** and disable only for specific, well-understood MCP tool invocations where you desire automation.  
* **Dirtyfile Protection:**  
  * **Purpose:** Prevents the AI agent from modifying files that have uncommitted changes (are "dirty" in Git terms).  
  * **Benefit:** Prevents the AI from overwriting or corrupting work you haven't saved or committed, ensuring your version control remains the single source of truth.  
  * **Recommendation:** **Always enable this.**  
* **External File Protection:**  
  * **Purpose:** Prevents the AI agent from creating or modifying files outside of your current workspace or project directory automatically.  
  * **Benefit:** Confines the AI's file system operations strictly to your project, preventing it from writing to arbitrary locations on your system.  
  * **Recommendation:** **Always enable this.**

## **3\. Auto-Run Mode and Auto-Accept Commit**

These settings determine the level of autonomy the AI assistant has in executing commands and committing changes.

* **Auto-Run Mode (Allow Agent to run tools like command execution and file writes without asking for confirmation):**  
  * **Purpose:** Bypasses manual confirmation prompts for AI-suggested command executions and file write operations.  
  * **Resource Impact:** If enabled, the AI can execute commands and write files immediately, potentially consuming resources without your direct approval for each step.  
  * **Recommendation:** For development, especially when first building and testing your AI CLI, keep this **disabled**. This ensures you review every action before it's taken, giving you explicit control and preventing resource waste from unintended loops or commands. Only enable if you have extreme confidence in the AI's behavior and the command allowlist/denylist are tightly controlled.  
* **Auto-Accept Commit (Automatically accept all changes when files are committed and no longer in the worktree):**  
  * **Purpose:** Automatically stages and commits changes made by the AI without manual review.  
  * **Resource Impact:** While not directly a resource consumer, blindly committing AI-generated code without review can lead to technical debt, bugs, and wasted effort if the AI's output is not up to standard.  
  * **Recommendation:** Keep this **disabled**. Manual review of AI-generated code before committing is a critical best practice, as detailed in our "AI Collaboration Guide."

## **4\. Why Granular Control is Essential ("Bang for Your Buck")**

* **Preventing Wasteful Inference:** By limiting the AI to only relevant commands and actions, you reduce the chances of it running unnecessary or computationally expensive processes, thus saving CPU/GPU cycles and potentially API costs (if using external models, though less relevant for your local setup).  
* **Maintaining Project Integrity:** Protections (like file deletion or dirtyfile) safeguard your codebase from accidental corruption or loss, saving you time and effort on recovery.  
* **User Control and Trust:** Explicitly allowing or denying commands puts you, the developer, firmly in charge. This builds trust in the AI system and allows you to integrate it into your workflow with confidence, knowing it won't act outside your specified boundaries.  
* **Debugging and Learning:** When an AI behaves unexpectedly, having a clear log of allowed/denied commands and actions helps in debugging its reasoning process.

By diligently configuring these settings, you can harness the power of AI assistants like Cursor effectively, ensuring they augment your development process efficiently, securely, and always under your direct supervision.
