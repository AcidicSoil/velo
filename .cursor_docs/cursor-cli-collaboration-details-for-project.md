# **Cursor.com AI Collaboration Guide for Your Local AI CLI Project**

This guide provides best practices for effectively using AI assistants, specifically within an integrated development environment (IDE) like Cursor.com, to build your "Local AI CLI Assistant" project. It will help you maximize the benefits of AI for code generation, debugging, refactoring, and general problem-solving, leveraging Cursor's unique capabilities.

## **1\. Understanding Cursor's AI Capabilities in Context**

Cursor.com is designed to deeply integrate AI into your coding workflow, often understanding your project context automatically.

* **Context Awareness:** Cursor's AI is inherently aware of your open files, selected code, and often the broader project structure. This is a significant advantage as it reduces the need for you to manually copy-paste context into prompts.
* **Chat Interface:** Use the built-in chat for conversational interactions, asking questions, requesting code, or debugging.
* **Inline Actions:** Cursor often provides inline suggestions or actions directly in your code, which can be accepted or modified.
* **Command Palette Integration:** Many AI features are accessible via Cursor's command palette.

How this relates to your project:
While your "Local AI CLI Assistant" aims to use local LLMs via llama.cpp and DSPy, Cursor's AI (typically powered by its own cloud models) can still be an invaluable pair programmer for developing the application logic itself in Python, defining DSPy programs, or structuring MCP interactions. If Cursor were to support custom OpenAI API endpoints in the future, you could potentially connect it to your local llama.cpp server. For now, focus on using Cursor's native AI to build your local AI system.

## **2\. Leveraging Cursor's Context Effectively**

Maximize Cursor's built-in understanding of your codebase.

* **Open Relevant Files:** Before prompting, ensure the files related to your query (e.g., my\_cli\_app.py, dspy\_modules.py, your pyproject.toml) are open in Cursor. The AI will use these for context.
* **Select Code Snippets:** For specific modifications, explanations, or debugging, highlight the exact code snippet. This tells the AI precisely what part of the file you're focusing on.
* **Mention Files in Chat:** Even with files open, explicitly mentioning a file name (e.g., "In my\_cli\_app.py, can you...") can help reinforce context.
* **Project-Level Questions:** For broader architectural advice (e.g., "How should I structure my DSPy modules for natural language to bash command generation?"), ensure Cursor has access to your project structure.

## **3\. Crafting Effective Prompts in Cursor**

The quality of AI output in Cursor, as with any AI, depends on your prompts.

* **Be Specific and Clear:**
  * **Bad Prompt:** "Fix this code."
  * **Good Prompt:** "I'm getting a FileNotFoundError when my\_cli\_app.py tries to read a file. Here's the traceback: \[paste traceback\]. Review the get\_file\_content function and suggest a robust way to handle the error, returning an empty string if the file doesn't exist. Also, ensure it adheres to PEP 8."
* **Specify Language and Frameworks:** Always reiterate Python, DSPy, Click, MCP, uv, ruff as necessary.
  * "Write a Python function for a dspy.Module that implements a CodeCompletion signature. It should take code\_context and target\_line as inputs, and output completed\_code."
* **Define Inputs/Outputs/Constraints:**
  * "Generate a Bash command for removing a directory. The command should be safe and remove the directory recursively, but only if it's empty."
  * "Refactor this Python function for ruff compliance and better readability. It calculates X. I want it to be more modular."
* **Use Examples (Few-Shot):** If you have a desired pattern, provide it.
  * "Given input: list all python files. Expected output: ls \-R \*.py. Now, generate a command for: find all files modified in the last 24 hours."
* **Iterate on Responses:** If Cursor's initial suggestion isn't perfect, don't discard it. Instead, refine your prompt.
  * "That's a good start, but the bash\_command should also include an option for verbose output."
  * "The generated DSPy module looks fine, but can you add type hints and a Google-style docstring?"

## **4\. Iterative Development with Cursor's AI**

Build your project incrementally, using AI at each step.

* **Small Chunks:** Ask Cursor to generate small, testable units of code (e.g., a single function, a DSPy Signature, a part of your CLI's argparse setup).
* **Refine In-Place:** Use Cursor's inline chat or command palette to request modifications directly on the generated code.
* **Test Immediately:** Once AI generates code, test it. If it fails, feed the error back into Cursor's chat for debugging.
* **Version Control:** Commit your changes frequently. This creates checkpoints and helps manage AI-generated code.

## **5\. Project-Specific AI Use Cases in Cursor**

Apply Cursor's AI to the distinct aspects of your "Local AI CLI Assistant" project:

* **CLI Structure (argparse/Click):**
  * "Generate the basic argparse setup for a CLI with subcommands complete and generate."
  * "Add an argument \--file\_path to the complete subcommand."
* **DSPy Program Design:**
  * "Help me design a dspy.Signature for a CodeRefactoring task, taking original\_code and refactoring\_instruction as input."
  * "Write a dspy.Module that uses this CodeRefactoring Signature."
  * "Suggest how I can incorporate a dspy.Retrieve step to fetch context from local files for my CodeCompletion DSPy program."
* **MCP Integration:**
  * "Considering the MCP, how would I represent the current file's content as a context block in Python?"
  * "If I receive a ToolCall via MCP, how can I use DSPy to execute a corresponding action?"
* **llama.cpp Interaction Code:**
  * "Write a Python function to send a request to http://localhost:8000/v1/completions (my llama.cpp server) and parse the JSON response."
* **Code Quality (ruff & PEP 8):**
  * "Refactor this Python function to strictly adhere to PEP 8 and address any ruff warnings. \[Paste code\]"
* **Documentation:**
  * "Generate a comprehensive Google-style docstring for this GenerateBashCommand class."
  * "Write a README section explaining how to run the llama.cpp server for this project."

## **6\. Reviewing and Testing AI-Generated Code**

* **Critical Evaluation:** Never blindly accept AI suggestions. Always ask:
  * Does it solve the problem correctly?
  * Is it efficient?
  * Is it secure?
  * Does it align with my project's overall architecture and coding standards (PEP 8, ruff config)?
* **Run ruff:** After generating Python code, run ruff check . and ruff format . to ensure compliance.
* **Unit Tests:** For critical functions, ask Cursor to generate unit tests, then verify them manually.
* **Human Oversight:** Your expertise is irreplaceable. The AI is a powerful aid, but the final responsibility and understanding of the code rests with you.

By integrating Cursor's AI features thoughtfully into your development process, you can significantly accelerate the building of your "Local AI CLI Assistant" project.
