# 🚀 velo

**Privacy-first AI CLI assistant for developers, powered by local LLMs and extensible with Python plugins.**

---

## Overview

**Velo** is a cross-platform command-line tool that brings AI-powered code intelligence, project automation, and conversational workflows to your terminal.
It runs local LLMs by default (llama.cpp), supports advanced Python plugins (including agentic patterns via DSPy), and is designed with privacy and extensibility in mind.

---

## Key Features

- Conversational code analysis, summarization, and project bootstrapping
- Fast, offline-first Go core—cross-compiled binaries
- Pluggable Python extension system (write your own workflow automations)
- Model management and optional cloud LLM support
- Autogenerated CLI help and clear onboarding
- Secure, auditable, and open by design

---

## Quick Start

### 1. **Install Go (1.21+) and Python (3.10+)**

- [Go installation guide](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Python installation guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 2. **Clone the Repo**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AcidicSoil/velo.git
cd velo
````

### 3\. **Build the CLI**

```sh
go build -o bin/velo ./cmd/velo
```

_(Or use provided scripts in `scripts/` for multi-platform builds.)_

### 4\. **Run the CLI**

```sh
./bin/velo help
```

### 5\. **Try a Python Plugin**

See `plugins/example-plugin/` for a starting template.



Repo Structure
--------------

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/cmd/velo/` | Main Go CLI application |
| `/internal/` | Go packages: LLM bridge, config, plugin manager |
| `/plugins/` | Python plugins (built-in, examples, community) |
| `/scripts/` | Build, test, and utility scripts |
| `/testdata/` | Example configs and test cases |
| `/docs/` | Extended documentation and architecture |
| `/models/` | Downloaded local LLM models |
| `/masterplan.md` | Project blueprint for humans & AI assistants |
| `velo.yaml` | Default YAML config for Velo |

* * *

Developing Plugins
------------------

1.  **Copy** the `plugins/example-plugin/` directory as a template.

2.  Define your plugin manifest in `plugin.yaml` and entry point in `main.py`.

3.  Use the built-in Python bridge (see `/internal/plugins/`) for CLI integration.

4.  Document your commands, arguments, and returns in the manifest for autogen CLI help.


See docs/architecture.md and [masterplan.md](../../Downloads/masterplan.md) for deeper architectural details.

* * *

Testing
-------

*   Run Go tests:

    ```sh
    go test ./...
    ```

*   Run plugin/LLM/agent tests:

    ```sh
    cd plugins/example-plugin/
    pytest
    ```


Sample YAML test fixtures are under `/testdata/`.

Contributing
------------

*   Open an issue or pull request to propose features or report bugs.

*   All contributors must follow the [Code of Conduct](../../Downloads/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

*   See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../Downloads/CONTRIBUTING.md) for coding standards and plugin guidelines.


* * *

Security & Privacy
------------------

*   Velo runs locally by default; no data is sent to the cloud unless you opt in.

*   Plugins are sandboxed, and all capabilities are declared in plugin manifests.

*   All plugin installation and model downloads require explicit user approval.

### **Why This Works for Both Developers and AI Assistants**
- **Explicit structure:** Easy for AIs to parse paths, purposes, and extension points.
- **Manifest-driven plugins:** Auto-docs and safety for human and AI contributors.
- **Clear onboarding:** Steps for setup, build, and plugin development.
- **Directs users to architecture/masterplan docs:** Keeps humans and agents aligned.
- **Emphasizes privacy and security up front.**
